## Project Description
### PROJECT TITLE
Automatic Detection of Carcass Contamination
Keywords: Food Safety, E-coli Identification, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Deep Learning
### PROJECT BACKGROUND & AIMS
Beef carcass contaminations may be a direct cause of foodborne diseases and a potential cause for the drug resistance of human pathogenic agents, and consequently, turns this issue into as high risk and zero tolerance issue for food industries. Some techniques, such as pre-washing and “dag” removal, are currently employed which requires a human visual inspection, microbiological culture analysis, bioluminescent ATP-based assays, and antibody-based microbiological tests. However, these methods are labour-intensive and time-consuming. Although some technologies (such as X-ray imaging, Tray and spectrometer test) showed some successes in the detection of contaminations, they couldn’t practically come into the production due to significant delays in processing results and incomparability of required hardware with slaughterhouse configurations.
### PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1- Research/literature review report on examining the possible sensor solutions (vision-based camera solutions such as hyperspectral/multispectral camera, thermal camera, IR camera and RGB camera) for maximizing the visibility (contrast) of the contaminates such as ingesta and faeces and milk.
2- Develop ML/CV models for the detection of carcass contaminations such as faecal, ingesta, milk on the carcasses.
### TECHNICAL/PROFESSIONAL SKILLS REQUIRED
Research method skill, Programming language (preferably Python), Machine Learning and Computer Vision.
